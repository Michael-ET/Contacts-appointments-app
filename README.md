# Contacts-appointments-app

This application is a tool for storing contact information and assigning contact entries to timed appointments.
The app was built using react (components, state and hooks), Javascript, HTML and CSS. All components and their 
functions were built by me but the initial zip folder was provided as a code academy project in order to pratice 
starting a project from scratch.

The app makes use of UK phone and email regex's which ensure the user enters correct contact infromation. The app 
also uses controlled inputs on the appointment page to ensure the user enters valid info for an upcoming appointment
time.
